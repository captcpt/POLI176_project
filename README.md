## Final Project for POLI176: Text as Data

Final project for POLI176 at UCSD, SP23.

_Final report file note shareable._

This project looks at political party and the prevalence of key gendered words (targeted at the topic of women) to determine if there is a significant relationship between political party and the discussion of women
and women's rights in the State of the Union Address given by each US president. A random forest model was utilized to classify and predict based on text data; the model performed extremely well on training data,
yet it had worse performance when run against testing data. This performance overall suggests that there are potential challenges with new data and speeches, especially as there are uncontrollable factors such
as other prominent and/or more immediate issues at the time (i.e. COVID-19, international conflict). At this time it is determined that other sources such as Congressional reports could be beneficial and/or more
ideal to SOTU addresses for the main determinant of this relationship.
